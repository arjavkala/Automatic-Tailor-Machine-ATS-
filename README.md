# Automatic-Tailor-Machine-ATS-

In the current employment scenario, it is of great importance that the resume of the candidate should align with the job description provided by the employer. Many companies use the Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to filter out the candidate profiles based on the job description. This software matches the candidate’s profile with the job description and if the matching score is above a certain threshold, it filters out the candidate’s profile. The project aims to provide a matching score between two documents (resume and job description), using natural language processing techniques. The project helps the user to iteratively modify the resume and obtain a better matching score which increases the chances of getting filtered by ATS.

Analyse two documents (resume and job description), find out the extent to which these documents match and report the similarity score.
